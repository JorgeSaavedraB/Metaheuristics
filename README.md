<h1 align="center"> Python Implementation of Metaheuristic Algorithms </h1>

This repository constains implementations of various metaheuristic algorithms, including:

- Random Mutation Hill Climbing (RMHC)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Evolution Algorithms (EA)

These algorithms are applied to the following problems:

- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Knapsack Problem (KP)
- Quadratic Function Minimization
- CEC 2017 Benchmark Functions (https://github.com/tilleyd/cec2017-py/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)
